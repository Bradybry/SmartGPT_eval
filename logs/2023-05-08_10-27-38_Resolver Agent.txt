<question>Select the best translation into predicate logic: Some athletes don't get injured.</question>

<choice_A>~Ia</choice_A>
<choice_B>(∃x)(Ax • ~Ix)</choice_B>
<choice_C>~Ai</choice_C>
<choice_D>(∃x)(Ix ∨ ~Ax)</choice_D>

<expert_response_1>
<reasoning>Let's analyze each choice:

A) ~Ia - This would mean "athlete a does not get injured." It only talks about one specific athlete, not some athletes.

B) (∃x)(Ax • ~Ix) - This means "there exists an x such that x is an athlete and x does not get injured." This captures the meaning of "some athletes don't get injured."

C) ~Ai - Similar to A, this would mean "athlete i does not get injured" only talking about one specific athlete.

D) (∃x)(Ix ∨ ~Ax) - This means "there exists an x such that x gets injured or x is not an athlete." It doesn't capture the meaning we are looking for as it states possibilities but isn't focused on non-injured athletes specifically. 

Choice B is the correct translation as it represents that there exist some athletes who do not get injured.</reasoning>
<answer>B</answer>

<expert_response_2>
<reasoning>Let's look at all the choices step by step:

A) ~Ia: This is a negated proposition about "a" which says that athlete "a" doesn't get injured. But the original statement is talking about some athletes, not a specific one.

B) (∃x)(Ax • ~Ix): This means there exists an x such that x is an athlete (Ax) and x does not get injured (~Ix). This fits the original statement correctly.

C) ~Ai: Similar to choice A, this choice refers to a specific individual "i" and talks about their injury status. It still isn't applicable since we're looking for something related to some athletes in general.

D) (∃x)(Ix ∨ ~Ax): There exists an x such that either Ix (injured) or ~Ax (not an athlete). However, this doesn't have anything specifically connecting being an athlete with not getting injured.

Hence, option B seems like the best translation of the given statement.</reasoning>
<answer>B</answer>

<expert_response_3>
<reasoning>Let's analyze each option step by step:

A) ~Ia: This is the negation of "a" getting injured, which doesn't convey the meaning of "Some athletes."

B) (∃x)(Ax • ~Ix): There exists an x such that x is an athlete (Ax) and x does not get injured (~Ix). This choice correctly represents "Some athletes don't get injured."

C) ~Ai: Similar to A), it's just a negation of a specific individual getting injured.

D) (∃x)(Ix ∨ ~Ax): There exists an x such that x gets injured or it's not true that x is an athlete. This does not represent the claim correctly.

Choice B captures the intended meaning best.</reasoning>
