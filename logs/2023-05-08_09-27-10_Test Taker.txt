Responses:
<reasoning>First, let's break down the given sentence into its components:
1. England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.
2. China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds.

We'll analyze each of these statements individually:

1. "Not a necessary condition" can be represented by negating the implication (⊃). So, we have:
   ~ (France's subsidizing agriculture ⊃ England's importing beef), which simplifies to: ~(F ⊃ E)

2. "If...then..." can be represented using an implication (⊃):
   South Africa supplies diamonds ⊃ China promotes human rights or simply (S ⊃ C)

Now combine these two statements using OR (∨):
  (~(F ⊃ E) ∨ (S ⊃ C))

This matches with choice_D.

So the correct answer is D.</reasoning>
<answer>D</answer>

Let's break down the sentence and convert it into logical symbols step by step:

1. Either England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture, or China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds.

We can divide this sentence into two parts with an "OR" (∨) operator between them:

Part 1: England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.
Part 2: China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds.

2. Now, let's convert Part 1 of the sentence into logical symbols:
England importing beef = E
France subsidizing agriculture = F

A necessary condition can be represented as B -> A (If B then A). So, in our case:
F -> E => (~F ∨ E)

However, we need to represent that it isn't a necessary condition so we negate the whole expression ~> (~(F → E))

3. Let’s translate Part 2 of the sentence into logical notation:
China promoting human rights = C
South Africa supplying diamonds = S

An "if-then" scenario can be represented as (B ⊃ A), so here:
(S ⊃ C).

4. Finally, combine both expressions with an OR (∨) operator:

~(F ⊃ E) ∨ (S ⊃ C).

Thus, the correct answer is <answer>D</answer>.

<reasoning>Firstly partionated and analyzed each part independently and later combined both expressions with an OR (∨) operator.</reasoning>

<reasoning>Let's break down the question into pieces.

First, let us assign the propositions:
E: England imports beef
F: France subsidizes agriculture
C: China promotes human rights
S: South Africa supplies diamonds

The given sentence has two parts connected by "or". So we have a disjunction ∨ in our formula. 

Now let's analyze each part:

1) "England's importing beef is not a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture"
This means that if F (France subsidizing agriculture) is true, E (England importing beef) doesn't necessarily need to be true. This can be represented as ~(F ⊃ E).

2) "China promotes human rights if South Africa supplies diamonds."
This means that if S (South Africa supplies diamonds) is true, then C (China promotes human rights) must be true. This can be represented as S ⊃ C.

Finally combining the two parts, we get the correct symbolization:

~(F ⊃ E) ∨ (S ⊃ C)</reasoning>
<answer>D</answer>
