Responses:
Let's analyze the choices step by step:

1. Choice A: (∀x)[Fx ⊃ (∀y)(Jy ⊃ Sxy)]
This translates to "For all x, if x is a fruit, then for all y, if y is a jellybean, then x is sweeter than y." This looks like it could be the correct translation of the given statement.

2. Choice B: (∀x)(∀y)[(Fx • Jy) • Sxy]
This translates to "For all x and for all y, if x is a fruit and y is a jellybean, then x is sweeter than y." However, this choice incorrectly combines Fx and Jy with conjunction instead of using implication for them separately.

3. Choice C: (∀x)(∀y)[Sxy ⊃ (Fy • Jx)]
This translates to "For all x and for all y, if x is sweeter than y implies that both F(y) (meaning 'is a fruit') holds true about ‘y’ and J(x), which doesn’t cover our original prompt as clearly as we want.

4. Choice D: (∀x)[Jx ⊃( ∀y)(Fy ⊃ Sxy)] 
This translates to "For all x, if x is a jellybean ,then for every other variable ‘Y’,where  Y stands being fruits., it'll hold true that X would be considered sweeter."
After consideration between options A,D their orientation seems more apt in comparison with how our question information was provided.Area under discrepancy would mainly be around starting areas where predicate added
Fx in optionA predicates us saying"for fruits over complete domain" whereas JX creates domain just around Jellybeans having sweet value greater than other

Out of these options considering basic meaning we intend from our question translation I believe optionA still makes more sense as it involve domain coverage for fruits which allows us in this scenerio to concretely make comparisons with each Jellybeans sweetness_value

<reasoning>After analyzing all the choices, choice A is found to be most simplified and accurate translation following the domain of fruits and jellybean comparison.</reasoning>
<answer>A</answer>

Let's analyze each choice and determine the correct translation.

<choice_A>(∀x)[Fx ⊃ (∀y)(Jy ⊃ Sxy)]</choice_A>
This choice suggests that if x is a fruit, then for all y, if y is a jellybean, then x is sweeter than y. This is not accurate as it states fruits are sweeter than jellybeans.

<choice_B>(∀x)(∀y)[(Fx • Jy) • Sxy]</choice_B>
This choice suggests that for all x and y, if x is a fruit and y is a jellybean, then x is sweeter than y. This contradicts the given statement since we need to say that jellybeans are sweeter than fruits.

<choice_C>(∀x)(∀y)[Sxy ⊃ (Fy • Jx)]</choice_C>
This choice suggests that for all x and y, if x is sweeter than y, then it implies that (Jellybean -> Fruit), which seems incorrect based on the initial statement saying "All Jellybeans are sweeter" not "sweetness implying".

<choice_D>(∀x)[Jx ⊃ (∀y)(Fy ⊃ Sxy)]</choice_D>
Finally this collection states: If something exists such that it's true for every object in existence(for everything), assuming its property plays out as Jelly Bean; Fulfils the requirement of Sweetness Object around every fruity objects when compared against them.
 
The step-by-step thinking indicates Choice D accurately translates the original statement into predicate logic.

<reasoning>Choice A had fruits being sweeter keeping subset hierarchy wrong so eliminated; Choice B was internal collision by containing both subjects ignoring their mutual exclusivity(it tried enforcing binding together with sweetness condition between open variable considering one common existence); whereas option C provided condition of consquence that flipped their association; Finally remaining D provided accurate consistent hierachial relations between F & J using existance-holderness concept;</reasoning>
<answer>D</answer>

Let's analyze each choice step by step:

A) (∀x)[Fx ⊃ (∀y)(Jy ⊃ Sxy)]
This statement says: For every x, if x is a fruit, then for every y, if y is a jellybean, x is sweeter than y.
This seems to be the correct translation.

B) (∀x)(∀y)[(Fx • Jy) • Sxy]
This statement says: For every x and for every y, if x is a fruit and y is a jellybean, then x is sweeter than y.
This option unnecessarily combines Fx and Jy in one condition using conjunction instead of creating separate conditions for Fx and Jy.

C) (∀x)(∀y)[Sxy ⊃ (Fy • Jx)]
This statement says: For every x and for every y, if x is sweeter than y, then this implies that (only when true), that 1. Y must be fruit., 2. X must be the Jelly bean
Seems incorrect as it put the cart before horse meaning first took Sweeter relationship has base requirement

D) (∀x)[Jx ⊃ (∀y)(Fy ⊃ Sxy)]
This statement says: Forevery any object X , given its Jelly Bean , there are no cases where it can not find any object such that all instances where other object being Fruit lead to this Sweeter Relation.
True given condition “All jellybeans are sweeter than all fruit”

Therefore Option A seems to put forth definition better,
