Responses:
<reasoning>The sentence "José introduces Wilma to Kevin" should be translated with the predicate logic format Ixyz. We know José corresponds to j, Kevin corresponds to k, and Wilma corresponds to w. So we can rewrite the sentence as "Ijwk", which indicates that José (j) introduces Wilma (w) to Kevin (k).</reasoning>
<answer>B</answer>

<reasoning>
We are given the predicate Ixyz which represents x introduces y to z. We need to represent José introducing Wilma to Kevin using the predicate and the symbols j, w, and k. Since José is performing the action, he should be x in Ixyz; Wilma and Kevin are being introduced by José, so they should be y and z respectively.

<answer>B</answer>

<reasoning>First, let's identify each variable in the predicate logic. In this case:

x represents the person doing the introducing (José)
y represents the person being introduced (Wilma)
z represents the person to whom someone is being introduced (Kevin)

Now, we can analyze each option:
A: Iwkj - Wilma introduces Kevin to José
B: Ijwk - José introduces Wilma to Kevin
C: Iwjk - Wilma introduces José to Kevin
D: Ijkw - José introduces Kevin to Wilma

We are looking for a translation where "José introduces Wilma to Kevin", so Option B is correct.</reasoning>

<answer>B</answer>
