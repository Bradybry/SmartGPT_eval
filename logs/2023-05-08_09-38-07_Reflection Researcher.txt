<question>Select the best translation into predicate logic. José introduces Wilma to Kevin. (j: José; k: Kevin; w: Wilma; Ixyz: x introduces y to z)</question>

<choice_A>Iwkj</choice_A>
<choice_B>Ijwk</choice_B>
<choice_C>Iwjk</choice_C>
<choice_D>Ijkw</choice_D>

<expert_response_1>
<reasoning>The sentence "José introduces Wilma to Kevin" should be translated with the predicate logic format Ixyz. We know José corresponds to j, Kevin corresponds to k, and Wilma corresponds to w. So we can rewrite the sentence as "Ijwk", which indicates that José (j) introduces Wilma (w) to Kevin (k).</reasoning>
<answer>B</answer>
</expert_response_1>

<expert_response_2>
<reasoning>
We are given the predicate Ixyz which represents x introduces y to z. We need to represent José introducing Wilma to Kevin using the predicate and the symbols j, w, and k. Since José is performing the action, he should be x in Ixyz; Wilma and Kevin are being introduced by José, so they should be y and z respectively.
</reasoning>
<answer>B</answer>
</expert_response_2>

<expert_response_3>
<reasoning>First, let's identify each variable in the predicate logic. In this case:

x represents the person doing the introducing (José)
y represents the person being introduced (Wilma)
z represents the person to whom someone is being introduced (Kevin)

Now, we can analyze each option:
A: Iwkj - Wilma introduces Kevin to José
B: Ijwk - José introduces Wilma to Kevin
C: Iwjk - Wilma introduces José to Kevin
D: Ijkw - José introduces Kevin to Wilma

We are looking for a translation where "José introduces Wilma to Kevin", so Option B is correct.</reasoning>

<answer>B</answer>

Responses:
<response_1>There are no significant flaws or faulty logic in Expert Response 1. The expert correctly identifies the meanings of the variables j, k, and w as José, Kevin, and Wilma respectively. They also break down the sentence using Ixyz (x introduces y to z), leading to their conclusion that choice B (Ijwk) is the correct translation.</response_1>

<response_2>Once again, there are no notable flaws or errors in Expert Response 2. Like Expert 1, this expert recognizes that José is performing the action (introduction) and logically assigns each variable according to its role in the predicate logic format Ixyz. They reach the same conclusion as Expert 1 by selecting choice B (Ijwk).</response_2>

<response_3>Expert Response 3 also does not have any mistakes or bad reasoning. This expert explains thoroughly how each variable in Ixyz corresponds to a person involved in this introduction scenario: x represents José, y represents Wilma, and z represents Kevin. After analyzing all choices A through D, they too conclude that choice B (Ijwk) is correct.</response_3>
