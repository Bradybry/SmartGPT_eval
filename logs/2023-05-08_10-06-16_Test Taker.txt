Responses:
Let's break down the question and each choice step by step:

1. Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar: Lm
2. Neither Janet nor Latoya did: ~(Jl ‚à® Ll)

Now let's look at the provided choices:

A) Lm ‚à® ~(Jl ‚à® Ll): Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar OR neither Janet nor Latoya did.
B) Lm ‚Ä¢ ~(Lj ‚Ä¢ Ll): Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar AND it is not true that both Janet and Latoya did.
C) Lm ‚Ä¢ ~(Lj ‚à® Ll): Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar AND neither Janet nor Latoya did (correct translation of the original statement).
D) Lm ‚à® ~(Lj ‚Ä¢ Ll): Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar OR it is not true that both Janet and Latoya did.

Based on our analysis, choice C is the correct answer.

<reasoning>We broke down the question into two parts: "Ms. Jackson lent" (Lm), and "neither Janet nor Latoya" (~(Jùëô‚à®Lùëô)). Then we analyzed each provided option to find out which one matches these two parts correctly combined by an appropriate logical operator.</reasoning>
<answer>C</answer>

<reasoning>First, let's identify the main components of the statement:
1. Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar.
2. Neither Janet nor Latoya did.

We can represent these statements as predicates in predicate logic:
1. Lm (Ms. Jackson lent me sugar)
2. ~Jl & ~Ll (not Janet and not Latoya lent me sugar)

The original statement is a combination of both parts using "but", which works like a conjunction in predicate logic.

Now, we will analyze each option and look for the correct translation:

A) Lm ‚à® ~(Jl ‚à® Ll)
This means "Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar OR neither Janet nor Latoya did". This doesn't capture both components being true at once.

B) Lm ‚Ä¢ ~(Lj ‚Ä¢ Ll)
This means "Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar AND not both Janet and Latoya did". This doesn't express that neither of them lent me sugar properly.

C) Lm ‚Ä¢ ~(Lj ‚à® Ll)
This means "Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar AND neither Janet nor Latoya did." This correctly captures both components being true at once.

D) Lm ‚à® ~(Lj ‚Ä¢ Ll)
This means "Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar OR not both Janet and Latoya did". This also does not capture that they individually didn't lend any.</reasoning>
<answer>C</answer>

<reasoning>
Let's analyze the given natural language statement: "Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar, but neither Janet nor Latoya did."

We have two parts in this sentence:

1. Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar: We can represent this part as Lm (where L represents "lent," and m is for Ms. Jackson).

2. Neither Janet nor Latoya did: This means that it is not true that either one of them lent you sugar.
We can represent this using negation and disjunction:
   ~(Lj ‚à® Ll) (where j represents Janet and l represents Latoya)

Since both parts are true, we'll use conjunction to combine these two statements.

So, the correct representation would be Lm ‚Ä¢ ~(Lj ‚à® Ll).
