Responses:
<reasoning>First, let's break down the sentence:
1. Cecilia breaks my heart if, and only if: This is a biconditional statement, so we use "≡" for "if and only if."
2. Maria is either a problem or a girl: This implies an inclusive disjunction (or), which we represent with "∨".

Now let's build the predicate logic translation step by step:
Cecilia breaks my heart = Bc
Maria is a problem = Pm
Maria is a girl = Gm

Combining these components:
Bc ≡ (Pm ∨ Gm)

Therefore, the correct choice is:</reasoning>
<answer>A</answer>

<reasoning>Let's analyze each option in order to find its correctness:

1. Option A: Bc ≡ (Pm ∨ Gm) -> This translates as "Cecilia breaks my heart if and only if Maria is either a problem or a girl." which matches the original statement.

2. Option B: Bc ≡ (Pm • Gm) -> Incorrect, because it translates as "Cecilia breaks my heart if and only if Maria is both a problem and a girl.", which doesn't match the original statement.

3. Option C: Bc ⊃ (Pm ∨ Gm) -> Incorrect, since it translates as "If Cecilia breaks my heart, then Maria is either a problem or a girl.". It misses the bidirectional relationship of 'if and only if'.

4. Option D: Cb ⊃ (Pm • Gm)  -> Incorrect. The predicate positions for 'B' are switched here ('Cb' instead of 'Bc'), so even though this demonstrates an implication, it incorrectly places subject & object roles in relation to breaking one's heart.</reasoning>
<answer>A</answer>

<reasoning>First, let's analyze each part of the sentence:
1. "Cecilia breaks my heart" can be represented as Bc.
2. "if, and only if" implies equivalence or a biconditional relationship, meaning both sides must be true at the same time or false at the same time (≡).
3. "Maria is either a problem or a girl": This statement uses "or," which indicates disjunction (∨). So we have Pm ∨ Gm.

Now, let's combine all these parts: Cecilia breaks my heart (Bc) if, and only if (≡), Maria is either a problem or a girl (Pm ∨ Gm).

So we get Bc ≡ (Pm ∨ Gm), which matches choice_A.</reasoning>
