Responses:
<reasoning>Let's break down the given proposition step by step:

1. (∀x){Ax ⊃ (∀y)[(Hy • Ly) ⊃ ∼Bxy]}

First, let's translate the components of the expression:

- Ax: x is an apartment
- Hx: x is a house
- Lx: x is large
- Bxy: x is bigger than y

Now let's analyze the expression:

2. ∀x(Ax ⊃ {∀y[(Hy • Ly) ⊃ ∼Bxy]})

This translates to "For all x, if x is an apartment, then for all y, if y is a large house, then it's not true that 'y' (the large house)  is bigger than 'x' (apartment)."

In simpler terms:
"No apartments are bigger than any large houses."

So this matches with <choice_B>No apartment is bigger than any large house.</choice_B>.

<answer>B</answer>

Let's break down the given proposition step by step:

1. The proposition is (∀x){Ax ⊃ (∀y)[(Hy • Ly) ⊃ ∼Bxy]}.

2. Let's start with the outermost parentheses to get a better understanding:
   Ax ⊃ (∀y)[(Hy • Ly) ⊃ ∼Bxy]

3. Using the translation key, we can interpret this as:
   "For all x, if x is an apartment (Ax), then for all y [(Hy • Ly) ⊃ ∼Bxy]."

4. Now let's focus on the inner part: (Hy • Ly) ⊃ ∼Bxy.
   This translates to "For each y, if y is a house and y is large, then it is not true that x (apartment) is bigger than y."

5. Combining our interpretations so far gives us: 
   
"For all apartments x (which we are considering), for any large house y being considered, it holds that such apartment x isn't bigger than that specific large house y."

Now let's analyze the answer choices:

A - All apartments are not bigger than some large house.
This does capture most of our final interpretation but leaves some ambiguity regarding multiple instances of houses instead of specifying clearly 'for any' it states 'some', hence more likely false statements.

B - No apartment is bigger than any large house.
This matches up with our complete interpretation and looks like the best fit.

C - All large houses are not bigger than some apartment. 
It swaps what should be compared against which and hints at least one in comparison, incorrect

D - No large house is bigger than all apartments
It also swaps what should be compared against which but almost correctly represents universal properties; still incorrect

<answer>B</answer>

<reasoning>Let's break down the given proposition and its logical symbols step by step:

1. (∀x){Ax ⊃ (∀y)[(Hy • Ly) ⊃ ∼Bxy]}

2. For all x, if x is an apartment (Ax), then for all y, if y is a house (Hy) and y is large (Ly), then it is not the case that x is bigger than y (∼Bxy).

Now let's analyze each choice:

A: All apartments are not bigger than some large house.
This means there exists at least one large house that is bigger than all apartments. This seems to be consistent with the interpretation.

B: No apartment is bigger than any large house.
This implies that every single large house will always be strictly larger in size compared to every apartment.

C: All large houses are not bigger than some apartment.
This seems like a converse statement implying that there exists an apartment such that it's larger in size compared to every large house, which doesn't directly follow from our initial breakdown of the sentence.

D: No large house is bigger than all apartments.
This suggests no individual large house can have higher dimensions compared to all existing apartments collectively."

Based on our analysis of possible interpretations and evaluations of logic, Option B matches most accurately with our breakdown of both statements and their respective major propositions.</reasoning>
