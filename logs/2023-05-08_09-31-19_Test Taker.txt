Responses:
<reasoning>Let's analyze each choice:

A: (Kx ⊃ (∀y)(Py ⊃ Lxy)) translates to: If x is a king, then for all y, if y is a pauper, x is luckier than y. This correctly represents the statement "All kings are luckier than all paupers."

B: (Kx ⊃ (∀y)(Lxy ⊃ Py)) translates to: If x is a king, then for all y, if x is luckier than y, then y must be a pauper. This doesn't mean that kings are only luckier than paupers; it could imply there are others less lucky.

C: (Kx • Px) ⊃ Lyx means that if x were both a king and a pauper simultaneously (which doesn't make sense), they would be luckier than themselves—a contradiction.

D: ((∀x)[(Kx • (∀y)(Py)) ⊃ Lxy]) implies that every king and every pauper have some property Lxy without distinguishing proper relationships between kings and paupers.</reasoning>
<answer>A</answer>

<reasoning>First, we know that the statement is talking about all kings and all paupers, so we can eliminate choices B and D because they don't have universal quantifiers for both Kx and Py. Choice A states that if x is a king, then for all y if y is a pauper then x is luckier than y. This captures the meaning of the sentence correctly. Choice C suggests that if x is a king AND y is a pauper THEN x would be luckier than y in inverse order (Lyx), which doesn't match the given structure "Lxy". Therefore, choice A should be the correct answer.</reasoning>
<answer>A</answer>

<reasoning>Let's analyze each choice step by step:
A: ( ∀x)[Kx ⊃ (∀y)( Py ⊃ Lxy)] --> For all x, if x is a king, then for all y, if y is a pauper, x is luckier than y. This matches the original statement correctly.

B: ( ∀x)[Kx ⊃ (∀y)(Lxy ⊃ Py)] --> For all x and for all y, if x is king and x is luckier than y, then y must be a pauper. This doesn't accurately represent the original statement as it could also include non-paupers in its consideration.

C: ( ∀x)(∀y) [(Kx • Py) ⊃ Lyx] --> For each pair of individuals,x and  y , this assumes that when one of them being king would imply that another one being pauper which leads to situations where kings are not compared to multiple entities/groups(effectively only just kings and paupers). 

D: (∀x)[(K_ |(∀y)(Py)) ⊃ Lxy]-->This states that for every k there exists some individual/entity where everyone belonging to entity/individual are simultaneously considered to be a Pauper

Based on this assessment it seems like option A best matches the intended meaning</reasoning>
