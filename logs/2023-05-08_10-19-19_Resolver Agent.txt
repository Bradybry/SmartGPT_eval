<question>Which of the following propositions is an immediate (one-step) consequence in PL of the given premises? E ⊃ ~F ~F ⊃ G ~G</question>

<choice_A>E ⊃ F</choice_A>
<choice_B>F ⊃ G</choice_B>
<choice_C>G ⊃ E</choice_C>
<choice_D>~~F</choice_D>

<expert_response_1>
<reasoning>Given premises: E ⊃ ~F, ~F ⊃ G, and ~G. We need to find the immediate consequence using one-step inference.

A. E ⊃ F
This contradicts the first premise (E ⊃ ~F), so it cannot be derived in one step.

B. F ⊃ G
There is no direct link between F and G in the given premises. So this can't be derived in one step.

C. G ⊃ E
There is no direct link between G and E in the given premises. So this can't be derived in one step.

D. ~~F 
We know that E implies not-F (E ⊃ ~F). Since there's no information about an alternative condition for having F, we can't derive ~~(Double negation of) F based on current premises.
</reasoning>
<answer>None of these choices are correct.</answer>
</expert_response_1>

<expert_response_2>
<reasoning>Let's analyze each proposition:
A: E ⊃ F doesn't follow directly from any of the given premises, so it's not an immediate consequence.
B: F ⊃ G looks similar to the second premise ~F ⊃ G but is different and not directly related.
C: G ⊃ E doesn't follow directly from any of the given premises, so it's not an immediate consequence either.
D: ~~F is essentially a double negation of F. In classical logic, a double negation can be eliminated. Going back to the second premise ~F ⊃ G since we know that ~G holds true (from third premise), by modus tollens we can conclude that ~~F must also be true because if F was false then G would have been true.

So in this case, D seems like the correct answer.</reasoning>

<expert_response_3>
<reasoning>First, let's rewrite the premises using more common logical symbols:
1. E → ¬F
2. ¬F → G
3. ¬G

Now, let's see if any of the choices can be derived in one step from the given premises.
A) E → F: This is a mistake because it is not what follows directly from any premise and contradicts Premise 1.
B) F → G: This isn't an immediate consequence since we don't have F in our premises.
C) G → E: This doesn't follow immediately from our premises either.
D) ¬¬F: To derive this conclusion, we can apply modus tollens on Premises 2 and 3 (as ¬G implies that ∨F):
¬(¬F), which simplifies to ¬¬F.</reasoning>

<answer>D</answer>
</expert_response_3>

<response_1>Flaws and Errors in response 1:
1. The expert incorrectly dismisses Choice D by stating that there's no alternative condition for F. The expert fails to recognize the use of modus tollens with Premises 2 and 3.
2. The expert doesn't clearly analyze the steps required for each choice and concludes that no answer is correct without fully justifying their reasoning.</response_1>

<response_2>Flaws and Errors in response 2:
There are not any major flaws or errors in this response, as the expert correctly identifies Choice D as an immediate consequence using classical logic with double negation elimination and modus tollens.</response_2>

<response_3>Flaws and Errors in response 3:
There are no significant flaws or errors in this response either, as the expert uses common logical symbols (→ instead of ⊃) to rewrite premises, examines each choice individually, and accurately derives Choice D using modus tollens applied to Premises 2 and 3.</response_3>

Responses:
<improved_reasoning>Examining each choice and using modus tollens, Choice D is the correct answer. Rewriting premises with common logical symbols:

1. E → ¬F
2. ¬F → G
3. ¬G

Applying modus tollens on Premises 2 and 3:
Since we know that ~G holds true (from third premise), by modus tollens, we can conclude that ~~F must also be true because if F was false then G would have been true due to the second premise (¬F → G). Therefore, ~~F is an immediate consequence.</improved_reasoning>
