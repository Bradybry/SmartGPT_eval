<question>Use indirect truth tables to determine whether each set of propositions is consistent. If the set is consistent, choose an option with a consistent valuation. (There may be other consistent valuations.) A ⊃ (~B ∨ C) C ⊃ D A ∨ (B · ~D) A ≡ (B ⊃ D)</question>

<choice_A>Inconsistent</choice_A>
<choice_B>Consistent. Consistent valuation when A and D are true and B and C are false</choice_B>
<choice_C>Consistent. Consistent valuation when A, B, and D are true and C is false</choice_C>
<choice_D>Consistent. Consistent valuation when C and D are true and A and B are false</choice_D>

<expert_response_1>
<reasoning>Let's analyze the given propositions and see if we can find a consistent valuation:

1. A ⊃ (~B ∨ C) [A implies either not B or C]
2. C ⊃ D [C implies D]
3. A ∨ (B · ~D) [Either A or both B and not D are true]
4. A ≡ (B ⊃ D) [A is equivalent to B implying D]

Now we'll test each of the given valuations:

Choice B: 
A = T, B = F, C = F, D = T
1: T ⊃ (T ∨ F); this simplifies to T which is consistent with the premise.
2: F ⊃ T; this also simplifies to T which is consistent with the premise.
3: T ∨ (F · F); this simplifies to T which is again congruent with the proposition.
4: The final proposition becomes thus; 	T ≡ (F ⊃T), which means it turns out true.

Conclusion:
Every proposition in choice_B seems consistent by plugging in their respective values.</reasoning>

<expert_response_2>
<reasoning>Let's analyze each proposition and find a consistent valuation:

1. A ⊃ (~B ∨ C)
2. C ⊃ D
3. A ∨ (B · ~D)
4. A ≡ (B ⊃ D)

Try choice B, where A = true, D = true, B = false, and C = false.

1a. true ⊃ (~false ∨ false) => true ⊃(true) which is True.
2a. false ⊃ true => True
3a. true ∨ (false · ~true) =>  true ∨ (false) which is True.
4a. true ≡ (false ⊃true )=>  True ≡True , which stands to be True

All propositions are satisfied by the given valuation in Choice B.</reasoning>

<expert_response_3>
<reasoning>Let's check each given choice to see if it is consistent with the input.

Choice A: Inconsistent
Suppose that this set of propositions is inconsistent. This means that none of them can be simultaneously true. We need to build a truth table for this combination and find out if all have the same value in any row, which would mean inconsistency.

Choice B: Consistent valuation when A and D are true and B and C are false.
For this, let's evaluate each proposition:
1. A ⊃ (~B ∨ C) -> True ⊃ (True ∨ False) = True
2. C ⊃ D -> False ⊃ True =  True
3. A ∨ (B · ~D) -> True ∨ (False · False) =  True  
4. A ≡ (B ⊃ D) ->  True ≡ (False ⊃  True )=True

Since all propositions are true under these conditions, the proposition set is consistent.

We don't need to continue checking other choices because consistency only requires one case where all propositions work together at once.</reasoning>

<response_1>Flaws and Errors in response 1:
- There is no examination of the other choices besides Choice B.
- In this particular question, it is not necessary to do so, but answering only based on one choice can lead to a faulty conclusion if that choice was wrong.

Note: This expert did answer correctly despite the potential flaw.</response_1>

<response_2>Flaws and Errors in response 2:
- Again, there is no examination of the other choices besides Choice B.
- In this particular question, it isn't necessary to do so, but answering only based on one choice might leave room for errors if that chosen option were incorrect.

Note: This expert also answered correctly despite mentioning potential flaws.</response_2>

<response_3>Flaws and Errors in response 3:
- The mention of checking each given choice doesn't happen as Expert Response 3 focuses solely on Choice B. Although determining inconsistency wasn't their primary focus.
 
Note: In this case, all three experts arrived at the correct answer. However, they neither proved nor disproved inconsistency (in direct contrast with what they stated).

Responses:
<improved_reasoning>Let's analyze each proposition and find a consistent valuation:

1. A ⊃ (~B ∨ C)
2. C ⊃ D
3. A ∨ (B · ~D)
4. A ≡ (B ⊃ D)

We'll determine the consistency by examining Choice B, where A = true, D = true, B = false, and C = false.

1a. true ⊃ (~false ∨ false) => true ⊃(true) which is True.
2a. false ⊃ true => True
3a. true ∨ (false · ~true) =>  true ∨ (false) which is True.
4a. true ≡ (false ⊃true )=>  True ≡True , which stands to be True

All propositions are satisfied by the given valuation in Choice B.

As it only takes one valid example of a set of truth values for all propositions to be classified as consistent, we can conclude that the set is indeed consistent without evaluating other choices.</improved_reasoning>
