<question>Identify the conclusion of the following argument. All of psychology has gotten stuck in moral prejudices and fears. No one has come close to understanding it as the development of the will to power. However, if a person even begins to regard the effects of hatred, envy, covetousness, and the lust to rule as conditions of life and furthermore, as factors essential to the general economy of life, he will begin to get seasick. At this point, he begins to lose himself, and sail over morality. Thus, psychology becomes again the path to fundamental problems. (Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil)</question>

Responses:
<reasoning>Let's examine the argument step by step:

1. All of psychology has gotten stuck in moral prejudices and fears.
2. No one has come close to understanding it as the development of the will to power.
3. However, if a person even begins to regard the effects of hatred, envy, covetousness, and the lust to rule as conditions of life and furthermore, as factors essential to the general economy of life, he will begin to get seasick.
4. At this point, he begins to lose himself and sail over morality.
5. Thus, psychology becomes again the path to fundamental problems.

The conclusion is usually found at the end of an argument or after a 'thus' or 'therefore.' In this case, it's clear that statement 5 (choice D) is the conclusion.</reasoning>
<answer>D</answer>

<reasoning>Let's analyze the argument step by step:
1. All of psychology has gotten stuck in moral prejudices and fears (premise).
2. No one has come close to understanding it as the development of the will to power (premise).
3. If a person even begins to regard negative emotions as conditions of life, he will begin to get seasick (premise).
4. At this point, he begins to lose himself and sail over morality (intermediate conclusion based on 3).
5. Thus, psychology becomes again the path to fundamental problems (conclusion based on 1, 2, and intermediate conclusion 4).</reasoning>
<answer>D</answer>

<reasoning>First, let's break down the argument to identify the premises and conclusion. The first sentence states a claim about psychology being stuck in moral prejudices and fears. The second sentence talks about understanding it as the development of the will to power. The third sentence is a conditional statement (If... then...) about how one begins to feel seasick when they regard certain emotions as conditions of life. Finally, in the last sentence ("Thus..."), we can see that it is stating a consequence or conclusion based on previous statements: Psychology becomes again the path to fundamental problems.</reasoning>
