<question>Identify the conclusion of the following argument. It is hard not to verify in our peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that we observe in our everyday patients. The arrogance of our consciousness, which in general, belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes. Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts. (Sigmund Freud, The Origin and Development of Psychoanalysis)</question>

Responses:
<reasoning>Let's break down the argument:
1. It is hard not to verify in our peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that we observe in our everyday patients.
2. The arrogance of our consciousness, which in general, belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes.
3. Because of this (referring back to point 2), it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.

Points 1 and 2 set up premises or observations while point 3 provides an outcome based on those premises. Therefore, point 3 is the conclusion.</reasoning>
<answer>C</answer>

<reasoning>First, let's identify the conclusion. The argument starts with a statement about weakened intelligence in peers and patients due to emotions. Then, it explains that arrogance of consciousness is a strong defense mechanism blocking unconscious complexes. Finally, it leads to the main point: because of this blockage (previously explained), it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious and teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts. This final connection between cause and effect indicates that choice C is the conclusion.</reasoning>
<answer>C</answer>

<reasoning>Let's break down the argument and identify its parts:

1. It is hard not to verify in our peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that we observe in our everyday patients.
2. The arrogance of our consciousness, which in general, belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes.
3. Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.

The conclusion typically presents a statement that results from earlier statements within an argument or follows from those statements. In this case, statement 3 begins with "Because of this," showing that it summarizes or concludes based on prior information.</reasoning>
