<question>Identify the conclusion of the following argument. It is hard not to verify in our peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that we observe in our everyday patients. The arrogance of our consciousness, which in general, belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes. Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts. (Sigmund Freud, The Origin and Development of Psychoanalysis)</question>

<choice_A>It is hard not to verify in our peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that we observe in our everyday patients.</choice_A>
<choice_B>The arrogance of our consciousness, which in general, belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes.</choice_B>
<choice_C>Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.</choice_C>
<choice_D>It is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.</choice_D>

<expert_response_1>
<reasoning>Let's break down the argument:
1. It is hard not to verify in our peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that we observe in our everyday patients.
2. The arrogance of our consciousness, which in general, belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes.
3. Because of this (referring back to point 2), it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.

Points 1 and 2 set up premises or observations while point 3 provides an outcome based on those premises. Therefore, point 3 is the conclusion.</reasoning>
<answer>C</answer>
</expert_response_1>

<expert_response_2>
<reasoning>First, let's identify the conclusion. The argument starts with a statement about weakened intelligence in peers and patients due to emotions. Then, it explains that arrogance of consciousness is a strong defense mechanism blocking unconscious complexes. Finally, it leads to the main point: because of this blockage (previously explained), it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious and teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts. This final connection between cause and effect indicates that choice C is the conclusion.</reasoning>

<expert_response_3>
<reasoning>Let's break down the argument and identify its parts:

1. It is hard not to verify in our peers the same weakened intelligence due to emotions that we observe in our everyday patients.
2. The arrogance of our consciousness, which in general, belongs to the strongest defense mechanisms, blocks the unconscious complexes.
3. Because of this, it is difficult to convince people of the unconscious, and in turn to teach them what their conscious knowledge contradicts.

The conclusion typically presents a statement that results from earlier statements within an argument or follows from those statements. In this case, statement 3 begins with "Because of this," showing that it summarizes or concludes based on prior information.</reasoning>

</expert_response_3>

<response_1>Flaws and Errors in response 1:
- There are no identifiable flaws or errors in this response. The expert logically breaks down the argument into premises and then identifies the conclusion, which is point 3 (choice C).</response_1>

<response_2>Flaws and Errors in response 2:
- There are no significant flaws or errors in this response. The expert clearly explains their thought process, identifying the cause-effect relationship between the statements (arrogance of consciousness blocking unconscious complexes) leading to their chosen conclusion being choice C.</response_2>

<response_3>Flaws and Errors in response 3:
- There are no noticeable flaws or errors within this response. This expert also breaks down the argument into parts, then proceeds to identify that statement 3 acts as a summary based on prior information - thus validating it as a proper selection for choice C as the conclusion.</response_3>

Responses:
<improved_reasoning>All three expert responses logically break down the argument and identify its parts. They provide a clear rationale for choosing the conclusion based on cause-effect relationships, premises, or connections between statements. As all experts agree that choice C is the correct conclusion, there are no flaws or errors to address in their reasoning.</improved_reasoning>
