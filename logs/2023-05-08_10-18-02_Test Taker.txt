Responses:
<reasoning>Given premises: E ⊃ ~F, ~F ⊃ G, and ~G. We need to find the immediate consequence using one-step inference.

A. E ⊃ F
This contradicts the first premise (E ⊃ ~F), so it cannot be derived in one step.

B. F ⊃ G
There is no direct link between F and G in the given premises. So this can't be derived in one step.

C. G ⊃ E
There is no direct link between G and E in the given premises. So this can't be derived in one step.

D. ~~F 
We know that E implies not-F (E ⊃ ~F). Since there's no information about an alternative condition for having F, we can't derive ~~(Double negation of) F based on current premises.
</reasoning>
<answer>None of these choices are correct.</answer>

<reasoning>Let's analyze each proposition:
A: E ⊃ F doesn't follow directly from any of the given premises, so it's not an immediate consequence.
B: F ⊃ G looks similar to the second premise ~F ⊃ G but is different and not directly related.
C: G ⊃ E doesn't follow directly from any of the given premises, so it's not an immediate consequence either.
D: ~~F is essentially a double negation of F. In classical logic, a double negation can be eliminated. Going back to the second premise ~F ⊃ G since we know that ~G holds true (from third premise), by modus tollens we can conclude that ~~F must also be true because if F was false then G would have been true.

So in this case, D seems like the correct answer.</reasoning>
<answer>D</answer>

<reasoning>First, let's rewrite the premises using more common logical symbols:
1. E → ¬F
2. ¬F → G
3. ¬G

Now, let's see if any of the choices can be derived in one step from the given premises.
A) E → F: This is a mistake because it is not what follows directly from any premise and contradicts Premise 1.
B) F → G: This isn't an immediate consequence since we don't have F in our premises.
C) G → E: This doesn't follow immediately from our premises either.
D) ¬¬F: To derive this conclusion, we can apply modus tollens on Premises 2 and 3 (as ¬G implies that ∨F):
¬(¬F), which simplifies to ¬¬F.</reasoning>
